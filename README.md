# BIG MART SALES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The Data scientist has collected sales data from the year 2018, for 1531 products across 8 stores in
different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to
build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a
key role in increasing sales.

### Hypothesis Generation :
Make it a practice to do this before solving any ML problem. Ideally, do it before seeing the data
or else you might end up with biased hypotheses.
What could affect the target variable (sales)?
1. Time of week - Weekends usually are more busy.
2. Higher sales according to time of the day (morning and late evening).
3. Higher sales during end of the year.
4. Store size and location.
5. Items with more shelf space sell more.
